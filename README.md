## Projects

### LCMS (Law Chamber Management System) 

Law Chamber Management System (LCMS) is a web-based software that allows Law Chambers currently working in Pakistan to manage their workflow smoothly. It promotes the use of technology in law. In this emerging era of technology, the Law domain is lagging. LCMS is built with the aim to increase the use of technology and decrease inefficiency. The system enables lawyers in a chamber to manage their legal documents. The software also aims to provide the availability of legal documents, ability to consult documents during case preparation. It allows lawyers to manage their calendar and notify them about important events. It allows senior advocates to manage employees, clients, discuss legal documents using the system, and it also provides flexibility by performing a range of tasks that would otherwise be done by several systems. The system also enables lawyers to search for their relevant topic (previous cases or legal judgments) using smart case study features.

## Future Goals

My aim is to become a full-stack developer, with a focus on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. I aspire to master both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to build robust and scalable web applications. By gaining expertise in MERN, I aim to contribute to cutting-edge projects, solve complex problems, and create impactful software solutions that make a difference.
